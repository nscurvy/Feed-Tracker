# Feed Tracker

## Welcome

### Purpose

This project is a feed tracker app for personal use. An excel spreadsheet doesn't allow quite enough flexibility or
automation for my tastes. The intended usage is for us to log on paper the quantities of feed our ducks are consuming
and that we are buying so that we can calculate things like average costs per day, average consumption per day, see seasonal
changes in consumption, etc. One of the problems that makes an excel spreadsheet less wieldy is that we are raising
ducks for food purposes. This means that the number of ducks will be changing over time. So calculations of averages and
consumption *need* to take into account how many ducks existed at the time the consumption is logged. Since consumption
is also uneven and varies day-to-day and month-to-month, averaging needs to be weighted over periods of time and we flexibility
in defining the periods of time is desirable. The application shall also let us easily track the prices at different feed
stores and compare costs. For all of these reasons, I am writing a Python Application that uses a SQLite3 database for its
data layer. 

This project also gives me an opportunity for something to add to a Portfolio to demonstrate my growing skills with
software development and which is also something useful, fun, and interesting to me.
